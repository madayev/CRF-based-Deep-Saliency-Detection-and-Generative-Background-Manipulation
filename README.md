# CRF based Deep Saliency Detection and Generative Background Manipulation
Saliency detection using CNN and CRF, then we manipulate the saliency map by transferring saliency map to the image domain using GAN.

We proposed a method to detect a saliency map of object and manipulate the background of the given object. Saliency detection, which is to identify the most visually distinctive objects in an image, is useful as a pre-processing step for many computer vision tasks. Recently, great features from convolutional neural network (CNN) has shown considerable progress in this area. However, CNN-based saliency detection results blurry map near the boundary of salient objects. Applying conditional random field (CRF) in super-pixel domain can refine the saliency map from CNN, and make sharp and fine boundaries. Generative background manipulation is the scheme that neural networks find a different and suitable background for the given object. To manipulate the background for the object, we learn the probability model of the dataset by generative adversarial networks. In our project, we first present the saliency detection using CNN and CRF, then we manipulate the saliency map by transferring saliency map to the image domain using GAN.
